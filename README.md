# My-Telecommunication-views
this is a document for noting the studying and the trace about the telecommunictation field.

## Over see

## Error Contral Coding
which as know as ECC.
* reasearch areas  
    This is divide by [Best Readings in Polar Coding | IEEE Communications Society](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/best-readings/polar-coding), and I thought it's a good view about ECC area:
    * Information-theoretic basics
    * Construction and encoding
    * Improved and low-complexity decoding
    * Hardware and software implementation
    * coding for general channels
